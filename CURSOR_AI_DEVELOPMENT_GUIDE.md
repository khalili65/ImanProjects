# ðŸ¤– Cursor AI Development Guide
*A comprehensive workflow for building applications using AI-assisted development*

## ðŸ“š Overview

This guide demonstrates a proven methodology for creating robust, modular applications using a combination of AI tools. The workflow leverages the strengths of different AI systems: ChatGPT O3 for strategic planning and concept explanation, and Cursor AI for implementation and testing.

## ðŸŽ¯ Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Strategic Planning with ChatGPT O3

#### Step 1: Initial Planning Prompt

Use this template when asking ChatGPT O3 for your application plan:

```
I want to build [YOUR APPLICATION DESCRIPTION]. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan with the following requirements:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Break the application into distinct, reusable modules
2. **Layered Design**: Implement proper separation of concerns (presentation, business logic, data access)
3. **API-First Approach**: Define clear APIs between modules for extensibility
4. **Testing Strategy**: Include testing approaches for each component
5. **Progressive Implementation**: Order steps from core functionality to advanced features

Please structure your response as:
- Project overview and goals
- Architecture diagram (text-based)
- Detailed step-by-step implementation plan
- API specifications for each module
- Testing recommendations
- Extension opportunities

Make this suitable for implementation by an AI coding assistant like Cursor.
```

#### Step 2: Refine the Plan

Follow up with clarification questions:
- "Can you detail the API contracts between modules?"
- "What testing patterns should I use for each layer?"
- "How can I make this extensible for future features?"

### Phase 2: Implementation with Cursor AI

#### Step 3: Project Setup

1. **Create Project Structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir YourProject
   cd YourProject
   mkdir docs implementation tests
   ```

2. **Save the Plan**
   - Create `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Copy the complete plan from ChatGPT O3
   - Add a progress tracking section

3. **Initialize Development Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   touch requirements.txt
   touch README.md
   ```
